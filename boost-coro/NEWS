2009-04-29 Built new tarball based on Google Summer of Code 2006 tarball,
tweaked as follows:

- Support Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). 10.5 supports the Posix swapcontext()
  family of functions.

- Support Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), based on the GNU Pth library
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/). 10.4 does *not* support the Posix
  swapcontext() family of functions.

- Fix Windows "never heard of CreateFiber()" build errors.

- Support building with gcc 3.3, which lacks __attribute__((__noreturn__)).

- Enlarge default stack size from 8K to 64K. It's too easy to hit an 8K stack
  limit, especially on a 64-bit machine.

- Use mmap() whenever available for allocating stack, for better stack-overflow
  detection.

- Fix a couple of omitted #includes.

- Per Robert Ramey, include the generated .html documentation files as well.
