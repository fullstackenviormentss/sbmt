This libraray implements the xRs rule class. It includes the
implementation of two classes: Rule and RuleNode. The LHS of a rule is
composed of RuleNode's. 

INSTALLATION:

    make
    ./test < ../test/example.rule1

DOC:
    under the RuleReader dir, type 
     doxygen Doxygen
    The docs are generated into the doc dir. Use doc/html/index to 
    browse.

NOTICE:
    The rule reader (probably still) has problem in reading the rules
from a very larger file. So in stead of go through the entire rule
file, please segment it into chunks, and perform the operations in the
rule reader on each chunk, respectively.
