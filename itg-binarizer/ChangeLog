	* binal.cc: Filtering mode:
			cat rules | bin/binal -f >rules.bin 2>rules.log
		    
		    The .bin file will contain the binarizable rules from input while the .log file record the non-binarizable rules and wrong rules.
		    At the end of .log file there is also a line of statistics.

		    * Use "long long" for statistics variables (totalRules, bin, nonbin). 
		    * Changed NOOUTPUT to filteringMode.
		    * If caught exception (wrong rules), continue in both modes, but output the message to .log if in filtering mode.
