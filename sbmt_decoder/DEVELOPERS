this project is using autotools for development.
that means that to add new files/directories/libraries to the build process, you
should edit the appropriate configure.ac file or Makefile.am file and then run
./bootstrap to generate the necessary Makefile.in and configure.* files.

From there, you can proceed to use the typical
 ./configure [--my-settings]
 make && make check
 make install
to build/install.

====================== A note about autotools ==================================  

I am told unfortunately that while autotools create very robust build and 
install scripts, their input scripts are very sensitive to the version of 
autotools you are using.  Because of this, everyone developing code are probably
going to have to make sure they are using the same autotools version as 
everyone else.  

Sigh.  

<delete>
To make life easier on those just wishing to checkout and build the code, I am
including the scripts generated by autotools in the repository, so that they 
will not have to worry about the whole ./bootstrap process.

Nevermind, causes too many changes in source tree.  Instead, as we get closer to
usability, we can make nightly tarballs that include the configure scripts.
Before usability, anyone using svn should have a recent autotools.  Also, I am
downgrading version of autotools required to match HPC cluster.  sorry.
