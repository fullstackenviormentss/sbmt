Dependencies:
Already we depend on boost.  Likely we will depend on DB.  Third party 
dependencies will need to be built and installed on your own using that tools 
build process. You can install them to wherever, and specify the location of 
the libs and headers via 
    ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/includes" LDFLAGS="-I/path/to/libs"
or just have them installed in an expected system location.

install the 3rdparty lib:
cd 3rdparty/lw; ./install.sh; cd ../..

other than that, the expected build/install routine is

./configure --prefix=/where/i/want/to/install
make
make check # compiles/runs unit tests
make install
