*-* syntax-mira-features.pl -e <insertion-eword-list>  < rule_file > features

This script computes the following featuers:
    a) rule root features
    b) num of variables features. i.e., is_np_rooted=1
    c) is_e_insertion features if the -e option is used. And these features
        are computed only on nonlex rules without looking into the word
        alignments.
    d) num of label L features; i.e., np_nodes=3 .

*-* I also had the n_bad_rewrite=\d+ feature. It is computed via the following 
    command:

    cat rule_file | perl rule2tree.pl | python single-level-rewrite.py \
              > bad_rewrite_features

    The output is of form "rule-id \t featur-values". Each line
    corresponds to one orignal rule.

    The rule2tree.pl converts rule LHS to tree format, and single-level-rewrite.py
    reads in the trees and checks if they contain any bad rewrites. 

    Bad rewrite set is defined in single-level-rewrite.py

    The single-level-rewrite.py relies on David Chiang's tree.py.

*-* I generated the insertion-eword list from nonlex rules only, without looking
    at the word alignments. The script to generate e-insertion words:

    generate-insert-ewords-from-nonlex-rules.pl < rules > output
