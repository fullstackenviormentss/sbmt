change(v12): input and output filename options use zlib compression if filenames end in ".gz"
change(v11): if creating a new header, start it with "filetype=rule version=1.0" - steve pointed out that our docs require this :)
change(v11): check for "$$$" instead of just "$" on the first line to identify a header, in case you supply a file without a header but with the first rule starting with "$"
change(v10): hash table storage for overflows (should allow accumulation of e^-2 and up no matter how big total count gets) - (This means EM should be possible (using a 4gig machine) on 300 million + parameters without losing any information around count=e^15)
change(v10): --double-precision runtime flag selecting double (float is default)
change(v5): double precision floats (counts won't stop accumulating at around 2 million or e^14.5)
change: better error message when bad normgroups, and print command line
change: new qsh
