	* forest-em-params.hpp: 
	            ("zero-zerocounts,z",defaulted_value(&zero_zerocounts),
             "when a normgroup has all 0 counts for its parameters, give the 0 (not uniform) prob")


2006-11-17  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em-params.hpp: fixed bug: Jon May found an untested
	option combination for printing viterbi derivation forests only at
	the end (not periodically) which divided by zero.
	
2005-09-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest.hpp: bugfix: only record counts for a node *after* all
	outside top-down propogation is done (previously was repeated # of
	children times!).  so, no longer need to record bogus
	parent->NULL relation for leaves.

2005-09-12  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest.hpp: bugfix: inverse() not invert() of inside[0] - thanks
	Wei.  changed "outside" to "norm_outside" denoting that the value
	is actually outside/inside[0]

2005-04-13  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* count-id-freq.cpp (MAIN_BEGIN): added freq of freq and histogram
	bins by freq (binsize determined by total count mass)

2005-04-12  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em.cpp: overflow support works.

	* forest-em-params.hpp: teebuf now member so it doesn't get
	destroyed during validate_parameters

2005-04-11  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest.hpp: overflow hash table (accumulate_counts)

2005-04-07  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em-params.hpp: implemented --use-double-precision runtime
	flag

	* forest.hpp: made FForest template on Float (and FForests) - had
	to comment //DBP(outside_order); because dependent type resolution
	doesn't work. (have_print etc)

	* forest-em-params.hpp (perform_forest_em): pulled everything out
	of forest-em.cpp except command line processing and exception
	handling

2005-03-29  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* sortpercent.cpp (MAIN_BEGIN): fixed extra "0" in output

	* forest{,-em}.hpp: support normgroups weight_t prob_t and WD

	* sortpercent.cpp (MAIN_BEGIN): single positional arg: infile

	* forest-em.cpp (MAIN_BEGIN): write exception messages to
	log_stream and not cerr

2005-03-21  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* sortpercent.cpp (MAIN): is spurious 0 bug still there?

2005-03-17  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em.cpp (MAIN): VERSION to v6 and double-precision Weight
	default

	* forest-em.hpp: added --out-per-forest-counts-file and support.
	also --checkpoint-per-forest-counts (analogous to the --viterbi options)

2005-03-16  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em.cpp: removed -DSINGLE_PRECISION default - you may set
	that still at command line

2005-02-07  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em.cpp (MAIN_BEGIN): use teebuf for --log-file (also -> STDERR)

2005-01-27  Jonathan Graehl  <graehl@isi.edu>

	* forest-em.hpp: tempfile-prefix always appends random string even
	when specified

	* forest-em.cpp: --add-k-smoothing (add to denominator for normgroups)
