test everything.

had-* works

what about had-rules pipeline integration? - test it, may work. argument is had-rules --pcfg=training.pcfg-counts or had-rules -p training.pcfg-counts

length distribution in pcfg backoff - exponential p(stop)?

unigram backoff given parent, child index -> parent,* -> *

no. either you saw rewrite

backoff features get fixed weight, or some fixed method?

SGT? other smoothing of counts per lhs? binned counts? #1count pcfg rewrites feat?

nice thing about non-tuned params: measure ppx of data

validate smoothing methods using held-out trees.
