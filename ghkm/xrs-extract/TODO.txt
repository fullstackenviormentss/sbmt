* Speed up the last step of rule extraction:
  - read/write binary count files (instead of plain text)
  - reduce the number of passes through the DB from 4 to 2:
    * merge add_weight, add_norm_count, print_rules.
	 * this would prevent having both count and fraccount.
  
* More options to define of rule size, e.g.:
  1) # of PTB CFG productions in LHS
     (default, as in previous versions)
  2) # of non-terminal in LHS (same as 1, but includes pre-terminals)
  3) # of terminals and non-terminal in LHS
