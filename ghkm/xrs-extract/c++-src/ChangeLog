    -- added memoization into TreeNode::assign_alignment_spans
	                          TreeNode::assign_complement_alignment_spans
							  TreeNode::assign_frontier_node
							  PackedForest::cutLeaves
       such that, in the case of a input shared forest (not parse), the same
	   OR node will not be processed twice.

   -- -m now also affects the forest-based rule extraction.

   -- tree projection can now also project rule size.

  -- added -m <max_rules_per_node>

     the max number of  non-necessary rules that can be extracted from a node.
	 this flag doesnt affect minimal rules.
	 the motivation of introducing this option: when a rule to be expanded has
	   many (i.e., >10) admissible children, and there are many unaligned
	   words, there will be a large number of rules generated from that node.
	   sometimes, the extractor can consume more than 10G mem. Lower -U can
	   help, but this affects all nodes.

	   This problem is especially severe when operating on projected trees
	   since projected trees tend to have larger rank of a tree node.

   -- added support for forest-based rule extraction.
   -- added tree_proj
   -- addd query_db.

	* Added -i option: 
	when the '-i' option is set, an internal node labeled as *-BAR (i.e.,
	NPB-BAR) will not be counted when computing the big N , unless it
	is the root of the rule.

	* Added _nb_ignored_expansions into class State: 
		it is used to count the number of auxiliary non-terminals in a rule.
		After modification, State::_nb_expansions refers only to the
		non-ignored number of node expansions.

	* Changed the is_smaller function in State.h: 
	such that, when -T is set, the function now first compares the number of
	non-ignored expansions, then the number of lexical items, then the number
	of ignored expansions.

	* Codes before the above modifications are marked by tag:
		BEFORE_IGNORE_AUX_EXPAN
