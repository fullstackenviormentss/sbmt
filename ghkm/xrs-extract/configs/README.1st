Suggested convention regarding config files:

*.cfg.template  : configuration files stored in the CVS repository; 
                  if you see bugs/problems, feel free to modify them.
*.cfg           : your own customized configuration files reflecting
                  your environment (you should at least change $OUTDIR 
                  so that it points to a directory you own). Do not
                  add any .cfg file to the repository!
